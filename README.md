**Direct talk**

*This is the conventional way of talking to Vector.*

To direct-talk to your Vector, speak out a phrase with the word "Vector" in it. Vector will slam the floor to signal he has heard your prompt.
Then you can start talking after the chime. 

**Headless talk**

*This is a slightly more natural way of talking to Vector.*

Headless talk is a feature in GateOne where you can talk to Vector without having to prompt the robot. This means no "Hey Vector".
Just talk away without having to say anything else.

Please be aware that Headless only supports basic social featuress like "hello"

**WARNING : Vector might get triggered while you watch videos or interact with other people. Headless can be turned off in settings.**
