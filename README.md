**Direct talk**

*This is the conventional way of talking to Vector.*

To direct-talk to your Vector, speak out a phrase with the word "Vector" in it. Vector will slam the floor to signal he has heard your prompt.
Then you can start talking after the chime. dudum!

**Headless talk**

*This is a slightly more natural way of talking to Vector.*

Headless talk is a feature in gateone where you can talk to vector without having to prompt the robot. This means no "Hey Vector".
Just talk ahead without anything else.

**WARNING : Vector might get triggered while you watch videos or you interact with other people. Headless can be turned off in settings.**
